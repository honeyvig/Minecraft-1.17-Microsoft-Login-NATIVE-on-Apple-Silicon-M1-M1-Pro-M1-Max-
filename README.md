# Minecraft-1.17-Microsoft-Login-NATIVE-on-Apple-Silicon-M1-M1-Pro-M1-Max
To run Minecraft 1.17+ with Microsoft Login Natively on Apple Silicon (M1, M1 Pro, M1 Max), you will need to ensure a few things:

    Minecraft Java Edition (which is natively supported for Apple Silicon starting from version 1.17) is installed.
    Microsoft Login Integration: Minecraft now requires a Microsoft account for login, and this is managed via the official Minecraft launcher.
    Optimizing for Apple Silicon: Minecraft Java Edition has been natively optimized for ARM architecture, so it should run natively on M1 chips without needing Rosetta 2.

Here's the general process:
Step 1: Download Minecraft Java Edition

    Go to the official Minecraft website: https://www.minecraft.net
    Download Minecraft Java Edition for macOS. Make sure you download the latest version that supports Apple Silicon (Minecraft 1.17 and above are ARM-native).
    After downloading, install the launcher like any other macOS app.

Step 2: Set Up Microsoft Login

The Microsoft login is embedded in the official Minecraft launcher (version 2.x and above) starting from the transition to Microsoft accounts.

    Login with Microsoft Account:
        Open the Minecraft Launcher after installation.
        Click "Log in with Microsoft."
        Sign in using your Microsoft account credentials.

Step 3: Minecraft on Apple Silicon (M1, M1 Pro, M1 Max)

Minecraft Java Edition is optimized for ARM architecture starting with Minecraft 1.17+. On Apple Silicon, you no longer need to rely on Rosetta 2 as the game natively supports the M1 chip, and this should work directly without needing emulation.
Step 4: Launch Minecraft

    Once logged in with your Microsoft account, click Play to launch the game.
    You should be able to enjoy Minecraft 1.17+ on your Apple Silicon Mac with Microsoft login natively.

Optional Step: Improving Performance

To make sure you get the best performance on your Apple Silicon device, follow these additional steps:

    Increase Memory Allocation:
        Open the Minecraft Launcher.
        Go to Launch options.
        Select the Minecraft version you want to optimize.
        Toggle the JVM Arguments option and modify the -Xmx flag to allocate more RAM (e.g., -Xmx8G for 8GB of RAM).

    Use OptiFine (for improved graphics and performance):
        Download the OptiFine mod for Minecraft Java Edition.
        Install it by placing the OptiFine .jar file into your mods folder or using the "Install" option in the Minecraft launcher.

    Ensure Java is up to date:
        Minecraft uses Java, and you can download and install the latest version of Java (AdoptOpenJDK or OpenJDK) if needed.
        However, Minecraft 1.17+ comes bundled with its own JRE, so you might not need to worry about this.

Step 5: Troubleshooting

If you run into issues (such as login errors or performance problems), here are some troubleshooting tips:

    Check Minecraft Version: Make sure you're using Minecraft 1.17 or higher for better compatibility with Apple Silicon.
